# Udacity-VRDevelopet-Project3

This Udacity project includes a series of assets used to build a VR app of a Maze that I developed for the assignment.
The purpose of the project was to understand how scripting works in the game engine and apply those skills onto the provided scripts in these files.
The scripts include features allowing the user to be able to travel to the location of selected waypoints, collect coins and keys when clicked, and open a door after the key is collected.
